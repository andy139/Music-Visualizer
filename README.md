# Music-Visualizer

This project is an audio visualizer that I created when I first started learning how to code. The visualizer utilizes the p5 frequency and amplitude libraries. On my website you will see that you can play through three of my favorite Taylor Swift songs/remixes. Each song has been specifically selected to show different visualizer effects. Note:The visualizer is best experienced with headphones on.
